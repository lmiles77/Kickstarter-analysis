# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project 

Louise is a playwright who wants to bring her play Fever to the stage. However, to do so, Louise needs funding. She has done some research of the budget needed to produce her play and found that she will need at minimum, $10,000. She would like to be able to connect with members of her community who are interested in supporting the arts. Therefore, she has turned to crowd sourcing as a primary way of generating funding. Louise wants to avoid any potential missteps by using data from successful and unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns to help guide her decision-making.  


### Purpose

Louise needs information that will help her launch a successful Kickstarter campaign. The results on this analysis will support Louise in two ways:

1.	Louise will be able to determine the best month to launch her funding campaign.
2.	Louis will also be able to use these findings to identify an attainable pledge goal. 

This analysis will provide Louis with information that will assist her in making informed decisions so that she has a successful Kickstarter campaign and is ultimately able to bring her play Fever to life. 


## Analysis and Challenges

The Kickstarter data has revealed the importance of launching a funding campaign at the right time of year. In the chart titled Outcomes based on launch date we see theater/play funding campaigns were launched during each month of the year. However, not all of them resulted in successful outcomes. There were many campaigns that failed or were canceled prior to the end date. Some additional data currently not available which would be helpful to helping us to develop a more complete understanding of these outcomes would include survey data from each Kickstarter campaigns’ lead organizer. An exit survey with the following questions may help organizers like Louise to better plan and market their campaigns. Possible survey questions:
1.	Does your city/community have an active arts scene?
2.	On what social-media platforms did you market you Kickstarter campaign?
3.	What genre of play were you aiming to fund?
4.	Was this campaign designed to fund the entire budget for the play, or are you doing multiple rounds of fundraising?
5.	Were there other factors beyond funding that influenced the cancelation of your Kickstarter campaign?
6.	Is this your first time organizing a Kickstarter campaign?

Additionally, it may also be beneficial to survey backers or friends of successful Kickstarter campaigns to learn why they supported the campaign. Possible survey questions include:
1.	Have you ever participated in theater or been in a play?
2.	Have you ever supported any other theater/play Kickstarter campaign?
3.	How did you hear about this campaign?
4.	What is your household yearly income?

Having these additional data points may assist lead organizers like Louise to better identify and target potential supporters in their city/communities who also value the arts and are therefore more likely to support their campaigns.

The goal amount of a funding campaign should also be carefully considered when planning a campaign. In the chart titled Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals we can see a wide range of goal campaigns from less than $1000 to greater than $50000. We can see 76% of successful campaigns were for less than $1000. Followed by campaigns ranging from $1000 to just below $5000 which saw a 73% successful rate. There were some campaigns with much higher targets who met their goal. Sixty-seven percent of campaigns ranging from $35000 to $44999 also met their goal. Because there are multiple instances where we see failed and canceled campaigns at all levels, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why. For this reason, we suggest limiting fundraising to less than $5000 and doing multiple rounds of funding to reach/exceed total funding goals. 

It would also be informative to separate established theater companies and like organization’s Kickstarter campaigns from those which are more grassroots efforts. Having data that closely aligns organizations with resources similar to their own will help them to better plan for a successful campaign. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


Based on our analysis, the month of May is the most successful month for launching theater/play specific Kickstarter campaigns. In the chart below we see in the month of May, there were 111 successful theatre/play campaigns launched. May is then followed by June and July which had 100 and 87 successful campaigns, respectively. Months that fall towards the end of year should considered less as fewer campaigns see success during this time. Time of year alone should not be the single factor when determining when to launch a campaign. Other factors should also be considered. 
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on our analysis, theater/play specific Kickstarter campaigns have found the most success with pledge goals below $1000. In the chart below we see 76% of campaigns with funding goals below $1000 were successful. This is followed closely by campaigns ranging from $1000 to $4999, where 73% of theatre/play campaigns found success. Unsuccessful campaigns occurred at each goal range.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I found it a somewhat difficult to start writing formulas in the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet. I made numerous typing errors as I was trying to change the formula in each cell to reflect the values I needed. As a result, I saw there were some errors on my sheet. I used filters to check my work and was able to determine that had included values equal to $50000 providing me with two data points that should not have been a part of my data set. 

## Results

Two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that the time of year a campaign is launched has a tremendous impact on how successful the campaign will be. Also, the latter months of the year, October, November, and December should be avoided if possible as we see a decrease in the number of successful campaigns during this time. 

The Outcomes based on Goals data allowed me to see that the most successful campaigns have smaller goals. I was also able to see successful campaigns at some of the larger goal ranges, however I wonder if they were campaigns for more established organization as opposed to more grassroots efforts
