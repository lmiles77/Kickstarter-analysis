Kickstarter Campaign Analysis-What work!
The following are findings from a crowdfunding campaign. Our friend Louise is interested in finding funding for her play Fever as well as other fundraising opportunities. To begin, of the 912 theatre Kickstarter campaigns, 525 were successfully funded, meaning they received 100% or more of their fundraising goal.
